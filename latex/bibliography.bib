abstract = {s this, we begin by implementing a novel methodology to estimate the probability of computerisation for 702 detailed occupations, using a Gaussian process classifier. Based on these estimates, we examine ex- pected impacts of future computerisation on US labour market outcomes, with the primary objective of analysing the number of jobs at risk and the relationship between an occupation’s probability of computerisation, wages and educational attainment. According to our estimates, about 47 percent of total US employment is at risk. We further provide evidence that wages and educational attainment exhibit a strong negative relation- ship with an occupation’s probability of computerisation.},

@article{Kawa2010,
abstract = {There are two main contributions of the work presented in this paper. The first one is a particular approach to adapting multi-agent system and graph algorithms to the supply chain configuration in personal computer industry. The DyConSC model is described. The next contributions are the simulation experiments carried out in the NetLogo platform. The DyConSC (Dynamic Configuration of Supply Chain) model is based on the software agents. This model is adapted from [7] and extended here with the graph theory. It is mainly aimed at building dynamic and flexible temporary supply chains. Nowadays it is especially important because customer demand, production lines and distribution network frequently change. This model enables each entity of the supply chain to independently adjust their plans in such a way that they become optimal both within one enterprise and the whole supply chain. Such a supply chain may be successfully realized by agent oriented systems. Agents representing various enterprises from particular tiers cooperate with one another, coordinate and negotiate conditions to achieve the common goal whereas every agent may try to attain the target of the individual user delegating it. Thanks to that optimizing supply chains holistically and obtaining significant benefits for the final customer become attainable, even if supply chain partners have differing objectives, perspectives and processes [3]. In order to check the capabilities of supply chain configuration and its effectiveness the simulations of the DyConSC model in the NetLogo (a cross-platform multi-agent programmable modelling platform) were carried out. The assumptions and environment of the modelling system are discussed. The experiment simulations are described, too. In the last section of this paper the results of the simulations and the findings are provided.},

abstract = {This chapter introduces the topic of this book by present- ing the fields of supply chain management, multiagent systems, and the merger of these two fields into multiagent-based supply chain manage- ment. More precisely, the problems encountered in supply chains and the techniques to address these problems are first presented. Multiagent systems are next broadly presented, before focusing on how agents can contribute to solving problems in supply chains.},

abstract = {We examine whether firms that emphasize decision making based on data and business analytics (“data driven decision making” or DDD) show higher performance. Using detailed survey data on the business practices and information technology investments of 179 large publicly traded firms, we find that firms that adopt DDD have output and productivity that is 5-6\% higher than what would be expected given their other investments and information technology usage. Furthermore, the relationship between DDD and performance also appears in other performance measures such as asset utilization, return on equity and market value. Using instrumental variables methods, we find evidence that the effect of DDD on the productivity do not appear to be due to reverse causality. Our results provide some of the first large scale data on the direct connection between data-driven decision making and firm performance.},
